#flume-taildir-v2-source
Source of Flume NG for tailing files in a directory. This source is based on flume-taildirectory and XMLWinEvent version. The two sources have been packaged in a single jar extracting commons features.

Features:
* Whitelist and blacklist for including/excluding files to monitor
* Recovery mechanism in case flume dies
* Now, it is possible to read files on startup
* Process both xml and single event line files.
* It is possible to set both number of events or max time in seconds to inject events to channel

#Compilation
```
mvn clean package
```

#Dependecies
This project depends on next libs:
* jpathwatch (v 0.95)
* metrics-core (v 3.1.1)
* stax
* This source uses streams, so be sure to execute under a Java8 enviroment

#Use
Make the directory in flume installation path ```$FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/watchdir-v2/lib``` and copy the file   ```watchdir--X.Y.Z.jar```.  
Edit flume configuration file with the parameters above.

## Metrics
All metrics related to number of events are based on entering events. The outgoing events (exceptions joined events) are not kept in mind when metrics are calculated


## Log changes
* Fix a bug found under high load conditions
